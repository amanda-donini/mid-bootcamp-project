## Project Description

The vegetarian diets are increasing world wide in recent years, and with that the necessity to create products that can replace meat in it’s sensorial and nutricional aspects. The Vegetarian Butcher is one of the companies that creates products to replace meat, replicating the taste and the texture of meat products. But what is the customer’s opinion about these products? Which insights can we get from this reviews in order to improve these products? That's is what I answer in this project.
